# 🧠 ProofHabit

ProofHabit is a cross-platform productivity app that helps users build lasting habits through AI-powered insights and **group-based accountability**. Users can track habits, receive intelligent nudges, and post daily “proof” (screenshots, links, or notes) in shared groups to stay motivated and consistent.

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ **Smart Habit Tracking** – Log daily habits and visualize your streaks
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Nudges** – Personalized encouragement using OpenAI GPT
- 👥 **Group Accountability** – Join groups and post proof of habit completion
- 📊 **Behavioral Analytics** – Identify patterns and optimal times for habits
- 📸 **Media Support** – Upload screenshots, links, or notes as proof

Let me know if you'd like:
- A version that includes both frontend + backend folders
- Tailored branding/colors or images
- A starter Express + Postgres backend to match this

I'm happy to make that too.
