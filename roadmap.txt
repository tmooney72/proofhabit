Backend	Python (FastAPI)
Database	PostgreSQL (Supabase or Railway)
Auth	Firebase Auth or Supabase Auth
ML/NLP	Scikit-learn + OpenAI (LangChain optional)
File Upload	Firebase Storage or Cloudinary
Maps/Charts	Recharts / Victory for analytics
Deployment	Vercel (frontend), Railway or Render (API)

🚧 PHASE 1: Foundations (1 Week)
✅ Tasks:
Set up GitHub repo & branch strategy

Scaffold frontend (Expo for React Native, Vite for web)

Scaffold backend with FastAPI and connect to PostgreSQL

Set up Supabase or Firebase for auth

🔗 Deliverables:
Login/signup screen

Authenticated dashboard layout

Basic backend route: GET /user/:id/habits

🚀 PHASE 2: Core Habit Tracker (2 Weeks)
✅ Tasks:
Users can:

Create/edit/delete habits (goal, frequency, reminder)

Log habit completions

View calendar-style streaks

Backend endpoints:

POST /habits

POST /habits/:id/log

GET /habits/:id/stats

🔗 Deliverables:
Habit dashboard + log button

Calendar view with green/red markers

Local notifications/reminders (optional)

🧠 PHASE 3: AI Nudges & Behavioral Insights (2 Weeks)
✅ Tasks:
Collect user habit logs

Analyze patterns using:

Time-of-day success rates

Missed habit clustering

Integrate GPT for nudges via OpenAI

Backend:
GET /habits/:id/patterns

POST /nudges → returns text

🔗 Deliverables:
"Your best time to act is..." widget

Daily nudge card (GPT message)

Accuracy improves as data grows

👥 PHASE 4: Group Accountability System (2–3 Weeks)
✅ Group Structure:
Users can:

Create or join public/private groups

Sync one of their habits to the group

Post daily proof (text, image, link)

View other members’ check-ins

Backend:
POST /groups

POST /groups/:id/join

POST /groups/:id/post

GET /groups/:id/feed

GET /groups/:id/stats

Storage:
Images → Firebase Storage or Cloudinary

🔗 Deliverables:
Group feed (like a focused Slack channel)

Daily streak leaderboard

Reactions (✅ 👏 🔥)

🎯 PHASE 5: Polishing, Gamification & Testing (1–2 Weeks)
✅ Tasks:
Add gamified badges (e.g., 7-day streak, 1st group post)

Add global + group leaderboards

Polish responsiveness, mobile flow

Manual + automated testing (Postman, Cypress)

🧪 PHASE 6: Deployment & Launch
✅ Tasks:
Host backend (Render/Railway)

Host frontend (Vercel for web / Expo for app)

Set up OpenAI key securely

Set up domain & SEO metadata

Optional: Add analytics via PostHog or LogRocket

💡 BONUS FEATURES (Post-MVP)
Habit streak recovery: “Skip day with reason” (sick, travel)

Chrome Extension for quick logs

Dark mode + offline support

Invite-only groups with QR join codes

Public group explore page
